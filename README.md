# Article-Summarizer-and-Classifier
Article classification and summarization have a genuinely backhanded connection as article classification fall into classification issues rather than summarization, where it is treated as an issue of semantics. A significant piece of the summarization procedure is the recognition of the point or subjects that are examined in an irregular document. In light of that, we attempt to find whether article classification can aid administered article summarization. This framework aims to summarize and classify a given new/text using NLP and ML techniques. The classification algorithm uses “Random Forest Classification” technique to classify the given text based on a trained model, which uses 2300 classified texts retrieved from BBC news and divided into 5 categories namely, business, entertainment, politics, sports and tech. Using this methodology we were able to achieve an accuracy of 96% .On the other hand, the summarizer algorithm uses the TF-IDF (Term frequency and Inverse document frequency) technique, which measures the frequency and uniqueness of each word and scores the sentences accordingly. The top 10 sentences based on their scores are shown as the summary for the given article. This summarization technique uses an extractive approach rather than an abstractive approach for article summarization. The whole system follows a single-document, extractive and domain-specific approach to meet the required results.
